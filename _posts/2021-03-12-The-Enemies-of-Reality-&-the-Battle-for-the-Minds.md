A quote of a then anonymous (now widely attributed to Karl Rove) White House aide during the George W. Bush Presidency:
<blockquote>
The aide said that guys like me [Suskind] were "in what we call the reality-based community," which he defined as people who "believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality." I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism. He cut me off. "That's not the way the world really works anymore," he continued. "We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality — judiciously, as you will — we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors ... and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do." [The New York Times Magazine]
</blockquote>
The true enemies of reality are not those that manipulate the ways we see the world or how the world is presented to us;
no the true enemies of reality are the people itself, that like to be confronted with a simpler version of reality.
but, and there's a but, illusions are not really simpler, illusions if produced in overwelming quantities, tend to sovrappose one another, creating, in the end, a much more complex version of reality than reality itself. It seems to me that it is there the time when someone start to question the illusions, and search for attachments to reality.

It's inevitable to have mental models, representations of the world, simplifications, it's the way that humans are built, the brain reason via a two way discourse with what it perceive from the senses, expecting a certain inference based prediction about what the signals coming from the senses should and should not represent.
