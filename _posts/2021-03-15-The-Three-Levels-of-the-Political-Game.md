There are different ways to participate in the political game, but taking time as our reference unit in this brief analysis we can differentiate political actors that play in the short, medium, and long period.
<br><br>
A political actor whose game is played in the short period is the standard politician, those that have to rely on the election cycle, the routinely public opinion checking, and are constantly in the middle of the ravenous arena of fame and glory, of boldness and cut-throat competition.
<br><br>
A political actor whose game is played in the medium period is someone that takes a detached approach to politics, influencing ideas and policies. Examples are the media, lobbying activities, think tanks, etc. Everyone that has an indirect influence on public policies plays in this category.
<br><br>
A political actor whose game is played in the long period is someone who takes an even more detached approach to politics, at this level is required a quasi-total pragmatic mind, power becomes about power itself, as idealism at this level is nor effective nor even remotely efficient.
The main way through which the long period game is done is through assets control.
